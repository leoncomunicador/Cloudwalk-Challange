Welcome to the CloudWalk challenge repository.

To solve the proposed challenges, I used the Python language, the matplotlib, seaborn and sqlite3 libraries.

In the repository, follow the challenge files.

Tasks
Challange 1 - Get your hands dirty
Using files checkout_1.csv and checkout_2.csv with hypothetical checkout data, imagine that you are trying to understand if there is any kind of anomaly behavior.

Analyze the data provided and present your conclusions .
In addition to the spreadsheet data, make a query in SQL and make a graphic of it and try to explain the anomaly behavior you found.

In this csv you have the number of sales of POS by hour comparing the same sales per hour from today, yesterday and the average of other days. So with this we can see the behavior from today and compare to other days
